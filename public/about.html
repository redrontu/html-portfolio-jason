<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Jason, a former Mainframe COBOL Developer who transitioned from the corporate world to entrepreneurship. After years of working in tech, I made the decision to step away from my role so I could help build and grow our family business. That shift opened the door for me to explore new opportunities and focus on shaping a future in the e-commerce space.</p>
<p>Because of my passion for coding, I decided to refresh my skills and explore modern web development. I enrolled in courses on Udemy to relearn the fundamentals and discover how to build effective websites and landing pages. My goal is to use these tools to support our products online and create a strong digital presence that will help our business reach more customers.</p>
<p>Beyond my professional journey, I’m also a proud dad of two wonderful kids—a boy named Seigend and a girl named Karana. They inspire me every day to keep learning, growing, and building something meaningful for our family’s future. Every step I take in coding and e-commerce is driven by the desire to create better opportunities for them.</p>
